Feedback from testathon (5/2/25):
-->Consider having bullets lose energy every "bounce" (coefficient of restitution)
-->Make all walls breakable, prevents tanks getting trapped by holes
-->Consider making holes slow-down (rather than kill) tanks

Feedback from testing with cohort (6/2/25):
-->Consider a duplicating bullet special weapon
-->Conside a store with points rewards e.g. tank speed upgrade
-->Consider if holes randomly change location
