Snake:
-->IDEA: Add terrain effects e.g. water which slows down, ice which is "slippery",
         spikes which damage unless armour acquired
-->IDEA: Obstacles grow over time and therefore become harder to avoid

Flappy Bird:
-->IDEA: Gravity randomly "flips" which means the user has to change their technique

Asteroids:
-->IDEA: Wormholes appear on the screen which allow debris and your ship to 
         teleport to different locations on the screen

Tank Touble:
-->IDEA: Use a shrinking map and/or portals to allow tanks to teleport to different
         maze locations
