Snake:
-->IDEA: Add terrain effects e.g. water which slows down, ice which is "slippery",
         spikes which damage unless armour acquired
-->IDEA: Obstacles grow over time and therefore become harder to avoid

Flappy Bird:
-->IDEA: Gravity randomly "flips" which means the user has to change their technique

Asteroids:
-->IDEA: Wormholes appear on the screen which allow debris and your ship to 
         teleport to different locations on the screen

Tank Touble:
-->IDEA: Use a shrinking map and/or portals to allow tanks to teleport to different
         maze locations

Kung Fu (1984)
Possible twists:
-Player has to find the enemies on each floor 
-Some NPCs are on the player's team, they can help but player loses points (or health) if they hit them 

Snake
Possible twists:
-Player has a set amount of time to get to food before the map gets smaller
-There are ’poisonous’ foods that the snake has to avoid
-Can choose between different foods (player gets more points if they eat food close to the edges)

Simon memory game
- This concept could be combined with another game so that the player has to complete tasks or fight enemies in a specific order 

Vampire Survivors
> The game: you control the movement of a character who is being attacked by a growing horde of monsters, gathering power ups and weapons that auto-fire endlessly without your input.
> Possible twist: the logic of the game is reversed, so that you start with full power against a large but fixed number of monsters, and you must clear the map while your weapons and power ups become less powerful over time.
> Engineering challenge: large number of independently moving enemies.

Grand Theft Auto
> The game: you navigate a 2D city from a top down perspective, on foot but primarily by car, and complete various criminal missions while evading police.
> Possible twists: the structure of the game remains the same except the cars operate with a much more unforgiving simulation-based physics system OR you play as police rather than criminal and the goal of the game is to immobilise the chased car.
> Engineering challenge: simulating city traffic, fine tuning car handling, generating satisfying organic car chases.

Decathlete (Sega)/International Track and Field (Konami)
> The game: arcade game, played against second player or CPU, in which you compete in a variety of athletic events events via a range of input methods (eg rhythmic button mashing, precisely timed button presses etc).
> Possible twist: real world athletic events are replaced with fictitious futuristic contests with unusual rule sets and more involved input patterns.
> Engineering challenge: building a highly responsive game that can make reliably reward accurate inputs.

Fire Emblem/Final Fantasy Tactics/various SRPGs
> The game (/genre): turn based tactics on a grid in which you use various combat classes (eg knight, swordsman, archer etc) to defeat enemies or achieve map-based objectives.
> Possible twist: the units and game logic are explicitly based on Chess rather than bespoke fantasy classes
> Engineering challenge: challenging enemy AI and the construction of solvable challenges
