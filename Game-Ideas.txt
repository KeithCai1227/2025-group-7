Snake:
-->IDEA: Add terrain effects e.g. water which slows down, ice which is "slippery",
         spikes which damage unless armour acquired
-->IDEA: Obstacles grow over time and therefore become harder to avoid

Flappy Bird:
-->IDEA: Gravity randomly "flips" which means the user has to change their technique

Asteroids:
-->IDEA: Wormholes appear on the screen which allow debris and your ship to 
         teleport to different locations on the screen

Tank Touble:
-->IDEA: Use a shrinking map and/or portals to allow tanks to teleport to different
         maze locations

Kung Fu (1984)
Possible twists:
-Player has to find the enemies on each floor 
-Some NPCs are on the player's team, they can help but player loses points (or health) if they hit them 

Snake
Possible twists:
-Player has a set amount of time to get to food before the map gets smaller
-There are ’poisonous’ foods that the snake has to avoid
-Can choose between different foods (player gets more points if they eat food close to the edges)

Simon memory game
- This concept could be combined with another game so that the player has to complete tasks or fight enemies in a specific order 

Vampire Survivors
> The game: you control the movement of a character who is being attacked by a growing horde of monsters, gathering power ups and weapons that auto-fire endlessly without your input.
> Possible twist: the logic of the game is reversed, so that you start with full power against a large but fixed number of monsters, and you must clear the map while your weapons and power ups become less powerful over time.
> Engineering challenge: large number of independently moving enemies.

Grand Theft Auto
> The game: you navigate a 2D city from a top down perspective, on foot but primarily by car, and complete various criminal missions while evading police.
> Possible twists: the structure of the game remains the same except the cars operate with a much more unforgiving simulation-based physics system OR you play as police rather than criminal and the goal of the game is to immobilise the chased car.
> Engineering challenge: simulating city traffic, fine tuning car handling, generating satisfying organic car chases.

Decathlete (Sega)/International Track and Field (Konami)
> The game: arcade game, played against second player or CPU, in which you compete in a variety of athletic events events via a range of input methods (eg rhythmic button mashing, precisely timed button presses etc).
> Possible twist: real world athletic events are replaced with fictitious futuristic contests with unusual rule sets and more involved input patterns.
> Engineering challenge: building a highly responsive game that can make reliably reward accurate inputs.

Fire Emblem/Final Fantasy Tactics/various SRPGs
> The game (/genre): turn based tactics on a grid in which you use various combat classes (eg knight, swordsman, archer etc) to defeat enemies or achieve map-based objectives.
> Possible twist: the units and game logic are explicitly based on Chess rather than bespoke fantasy classes
> Engineering challenge: challenging enemy AI and the construction of solvable challenges

1. Pong
A simple two-player paddle game where players try to bounce a ball past each other. You can add scoring and increase ball speed over time.

2. Tower Defense
Defend a base by placing turrets to stop waves of enemies. Include upgrades for turrets and different enemy types.

3. Racing Game
A top-down racing game where players avoid obstacles and complete laps. You can add AI opponents for extra challenge.

3. RPG Adventure
A small RPG with a character, enemies, and a health/mana system. Players can battle enemies, find items, and explore a simple map.

4. Idle Clicker Game
A game where players click or perform simple actions to earn resources and unlock upgrades.

Snake
Add a two-player mode where players compete to score points. Colliding with the opponent's body or obstacles results in death.  
Tetris
Introduce different difficulty levels. Also, add a two-player cooperative mode where both players work together to clear blocks on a larger background.  
Tank Battle
Allow certain obstacles to be destroyed, and include special weapons like lasers or rockets. Some terrains have unique effects, such as hiding in grass or increased speed on ice.  
Breakout
Introduce randomly moving ghosts that obstruct the ball's movement. Defeating a ghost rewards an extra ball.  
Shooter
Add different weapons and special skills, such as full-screen attacks or invincible stealth mode.

Ajinkya's Picks:

1. Tanks. Why: not too ambitious yet not too simple. Lots of scope for change (new weapons, abilities, maps).
2. Kung Fu. Why: seems like a fun game, creating basic character animations sounds interesting.

Nagat's picks:

Pong- Would be interesting to put a unique spin on a fairly straightforward sports game (mixing realistic and fantasy elements).
Tank Trouble- I think the twist idea above would really flesh out an already fun game by bringing in a useful tool for players.
