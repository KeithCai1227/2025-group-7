Final idea: Tank Trouble

Our current plan for our version of the game incorporates all of the standard game mechanics:
-Two tanks manoeuvre around a maze-like map, shooting each other with bullets
-Players use key controls to move back and forth, and pivot left and right
-Bullets ricochet off of walls, bringing an extra challenge to the game
As in the original game, we will also include power-ups:
-Our initial ideas include a laser power-up that replaces the standard bullets when obtained
We have added two main twists to the game:
-When a tank stays on the square of a grid for a particular number of seconds, that square disappears and leaves a ‘hole’ in the map which tanks can later fall through
-Some of the walls of the map break when hit with bullets, changing the map as the game progresses
A potential challenge of developing this game could be coding the behaviour of an NPC if we choose to incorporate a single-player mode.

Idea write-ups:

> TANK TROUBLE
A multiplayer combat game in which players move tanks around a maze-like map, from a top-down 2D perspective, and score points by eliminating rival tanks.
Core mechanics:
- operating the tanks with "tank controls" in which forward and backwards inputs move the tank, and left and right inputs pivot rather than giving lateral movement
- collecting power-ups to make your tank sturdier and more powerful, and strategically cutting opponents off from power-ups
- firing shots effectively to hit moving enemy tanks, making use of projectiles that ricochet off walls in a predictable way
Potential "twists":
- shrinking maps
- use of teleportation portals that can relocate your tank instantaneously
- more complex map layouts that include areas that inflict terrain effects
- destructable environments to make the game more dynamic

> TOWER DEFENSE
A single player strategy game in which the player seeks to defend a tower from successive waves of enemies by placing defensive objects along predicted paths of attack.
Core mechanics:
- Placement of defensive elements prior to attack by enemy waves
- Collection of currency as a result of successfully eliminating enemy attackers
- Use of currency to maintain, repair, upgrade, and build new defensive elements
Potential "twists":
- tbd...

---- IDEATION ----
------------------

Snake:
-->IDEA: Add terrain effects e.g. water which slows down, ice which is "slippery",
         spikes which damage unless armour acquired
-->IDEA: Obstacles grow over time and therefore become harder to avoid

Flappy Bird:
-->IDEA: Gravity randomly "flips" which means the user has to change their technique

Asteroids:
-->IDEA: Wormholes appear on the screen which allow debris and your ship to 
         teleport to different locations on the screen

Tank Touble:
-->IDEA: Use a shrinking map and/or portals to allow tanks to teleport to different
         maze locations

Kung Fu (1984)
Possible twists:
-Player has to find the enemies on each floor 
-Some NPCs are on the player's team, they can help but player loses points (or health) if they hit them 

Snake
Possible twists:
-Player has a set amount of time to get to food before the map gets smaller
-There are ’poisonous’ foods that the snake has to avoid
-Can choose between different foods (player gets more points if they eat food close to the edges)

Simon memory game
- This concept could be combined with another game so that the player has to complete tasks or fight enemies in a specific order 

---

Vampire Survivors
> The game: you control the movement of a character who is being attacked by a growing horde of monsters, gathering power ups and weapons that auto-fire endlessly without your input.
> Possible twist: the logic of the game is reversed, so that you start with full power against a large but fixed number of monsters, and you must clear the map while your weapons and power ups become less powerful over time.
> Engineering challenge: large number of independently moving enemies.

Grand Theft Auto
> The game: you navigate a 2D city from a top down perspective, on foot but primarily by car, and complete various criminal missions while evading police.
> Possible twists: the structure of the game remains the same except the cars operate with a much more unforgiving simulation-based physics system OR you play as police rather than criminal and the goal of the game is to immobilise the chased car.
> Engineering challenge: simulating city traffic, fine tuning car handling, generating satisfying organic car chases.

Decathlete (Sega)/International Track and Field (Konami)
> The game: arcade game, played against second player or CPU, in which you compete in a variety of athletic events events via a range of input methods (eg rhythmic button mashing, precisely timed button presses etc).
> Possible twist: real world athletic events are replaced with fictitious futuristic contests with unusual rule sets and more involved input patterns.
> Engineering challenge: building a highly responsive game that can make reliably reward accurate inputs.

Fire Emblem/Final Fantasy Tactics/various SRPGs
> The game (/genre): turn based tactics on a grid in which you use various combat classes (eg knight, swordsman, archer etc) to defeat enemies or achieve map-based objectives.
> Possible twist: the units and game logic are explicitly based on Chess rather than bespoke fantasy classes
> Engineering challenge: challenging enemy AI and the construction of solvable challenges

1. Pong
A simple two-player paddle game where players try to bounce a ball past each other. You can add scoring and increase ball speed over time.

2. Tower Defense
Defend a base by placing turrets to stop waves of enemies. Include upgrades for turrets and different enemy types.

3. Racing Game
A top-down racing game where players avoid obstacles and complete laps. You can add AI opponents for extra challenge.

3. RPG Adventure
A small RPG with a character, enemies, and a health/mana system. Players can battle enemies, find items, and explore a simple map.

4. Idle Clicker Game
A game where players click or perform simple actions to earn resources and unlock upgrades.

Snake game: 
Eating one food upgrades the snake by one level. Subsequently, the number of foods required to upgrade doubles each time (2, 4, 8, etc.). Upon leveling up, the player can choose one of three upgrade options: length increase, speed boost, shield, teleportation, magnetism, or faster upgrades. By default, leveling up increases the snake's length and decreases its speed. There are moving monsters and obstacles on the map. Players can obtain weapons to attack the monsters. The game features a score mode and a multiplayer mode.

Tetris
Introduce different difficulty levels. Also, add a two-player cooperative mode where both players work together to clear blocks on a larger background.  

Tank Battle
Allow certain obstacles to be destroyed, and include special weapons like lasers or rockets. Some terrains have unique effects, such as hiding in grass or increased speed on ice.  

Breakout
Introduce randomly moving ghosts that obstruct the ball's movement. Defeating a ghost rewards an extra ball.  

Shooter
Add different weapons and special skills, such as full-screen attacks or invincible stealth mode.

Box-pushing game:
Within a time limit, players must create products and deliver them to designated locations, earning scores within a limited number of lives. Randomly moving small monsters act as obstacles, while a large monster tracks and attacks the player. Small monsters can be crushed with boxes, but the large monster can only be avoided. Delivering a certain number of products generates random items, such as speed boosts, additional boxes, shields, or shoes that allow players to stomp on small monsters.

----- VOTING -----
------------------

Ajinkya's Picks:

1. Tanks. Why: not too ambitious yet not too simple. Lots of scope for change (new weapons, abilities, maps).
2. Kung Fu. Why: seems like a fun game, creating basic character animations sounds interesting.

Nagat's picks:

Pong- Would be interesting to put a unique spin on a fairly straightforward sports game (mixing realistic and fantasy elements).
Tank Trouble- I think the twist idea above would really flesh out an already fun game by bringing in a useful tool for players.

Yaseer's picks:

1. Idle Clicker Game
A game where players click or perform simple actions to earn resources and unlock upgrades.

Defend a base by placing turrets to stop waves of enemies. Include upgrades for turrets and different enemy types.
